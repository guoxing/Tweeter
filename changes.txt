Major changes from Part 1 to Part 2:
  Data module
    Rdesigned the data module. Instead of using an entry style storage
    with arbitrary-length columns, we now use an entry storage with fixed-length
    columns which enables random access. Now the clients just need to
    subclass the DataEntry class to configure the entry format they want to
    store to use DataStorage.

  Exception handling
    Previously, exception handling was scattered everywhere. We now
    handle nearly all exceptions in Tweeter.java.
    Number of catch statements dropped from 23 to 13

  JSON module
    Consolidated into a single class. 
      - Lines of code reduced from 300+ to 168.
      - Changed from mutable to immutable.
      - Cleaning up of escape method
  Router
    Changed to use method references instead of a big switch statement
      - This made the Router class so small that we combined it with our
      main Tweeter class.
  Miscellanea
    Re-wrote complicated and non-intuitive code. Remove unnecessary methods. Added more comments.
    Overall, we now favor readability and robustness over performance.

Number of lines dropped from 2790 to < 2000
