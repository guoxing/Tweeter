Major changes from Part 1 to Part 2:
	Data module

	Exception handling
		Previously, exception handling was scattered everywhere. We now
		handle nearly all exceptions in Tweeter.java.
		Number of exceptions dropped from 23 to 13

	JSON module
		Consolidated into a single class. 
			- Lines of code reduced from 300+ to 168.
			- Changed from mutable to immutable.
			- Cleaning up of escape method
	Router
		Changed to use method references instead of a big switch statement
			- This made the Router class so small that we combined it with our
			main Tweeter class.

	Number of lines dropped from 2790 to < 2000
